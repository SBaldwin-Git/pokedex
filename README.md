# Pokedex

Pokedex is a React JS application designed to enhance your skills in React, Material UI, responsive design, and local storage. The project utilizes the Pokemon API to fetch and display comprehensive information about different Pokemon. While the initial version focuses on a frontend implementation, future considerations include the potential integration of a backend, possibly using Supabase for expanded functionality.

## Learning Objectives

### React and Material UI Practise
The primary goal of this project is to reinforce and advance your proficiency in React JS and Material UI. By implementing various components, state management, and UI elements, you'll deepen your understanding of these technologies and hone your ability to create interactive and visually appealing user interfaces. Just because i have coded in React before, doesn't mean I can't learn more about it. Some React tools like hooks and context are still difficult for me at times.

### Responsive Design
Emphasizing responsive design principles, this project provides an excellent opportunity to refine your skills in crafting applications that seamlessly adapt to various screen sizes and devices. Through thoughtful layout structuring and media queries, strive to deliver an optimal user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

### Local Storage and Browser Cookies
As an essential feature, the project encourages you to explore and implement local storage mechanisms and browser cookies. Learn how to save user preferences, such as favorite Pokemon or customized settings, persistently across sessions. This skill is vital for creating a more personalized and user-friendly experience.

## Features

- **Pokemon Information**: Access detailed information about diverse Pokemon, including their stats, abilities, and more.

- **Search and Filter**: Implement a user-friendly search functionality allowing users to find specific Pokemon quickly. Additionally, provide filters based on types, abilities, or other criteria for a more tailored experience.

- **Responsive Design**: Prioritize a seamless user experience across various devices. Ensure that your application is visually appealing and functional on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

- **Local Storage and Cookies**: Incorporate mechanisms to save user preferences and data persistently. Learn to utilize local storage and browser cookies for an enhanced user experience.

- **Supabase Integration (Optional)**: Although not initially implemented, keep Supabase integration as a future prospect. This may involve backend functionalities to save user data remotely, enabling features such as tracking favorite Pokemon and other personalized settings.

## What I Learned

- **Feature Creep**: As you work on the project, you may encounter numerous exciting features and ideas. However, it's crucial to maintain focus and prioritize the core functionalities. Avoid feature creep by staying true to the project's primary objectives and learning outcomes.
- **Language and Library Envy**: While working on the project, you might be tempted to explore other languages or libraries. However, it's essential to remember that the primary goal is to master React and Material UI. Stay focused on these technologies and avoid unnecessary distractions. Speficially after reading up on Next.js, I was tempted to use it for server side rendering and API routes, but I decided to stick with the original plan.
- **Responsive Design**: Strive to create a visually appealing and functional application across various devices. This will require careful planning and thoughtful implementation of responsive design principles. I often found myself testing the app in desktop view by mistake due to the fact that I was developing on a desktop. I had to remind myself to test the app on mobile view as well.
- **NPM Packages**: Utilize various NPM packages to enhance your application. I made use of JS-Cookie to store the user's favorite Pokemon in the browser's cookies.
- **Testing Use The Deployed App**: It's important to test the deployed app on various devices to ensure that it's responsive and visually appealing. I tested the app on my phone and tablet to ensure that it was responsive and visually appealing. I also found and fixed bugs that only appeared on the deployed app.
